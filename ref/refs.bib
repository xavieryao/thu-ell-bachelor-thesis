	abstract = {The use of source texts in academic writing has been explored in at least two groups of EAP studies, those on the reading-writing connection in student writing and those on citation practices in disciplinary discourse. In recent years, there have been a growing number of studies on the rhetorical functions of intertextual links in different academic genres such as research articles and theses, and studies have also compared citation use by novice and more established writers. Following a brief analysis of citation forms, this article explores the functions of source text use in the discussion sections of master’s theses and research articles from biology using two typologies, one created by Thompson (2001, 2005) and, the second, an expanded model described in this paper, which reﬂects the rhetorical progression of this part-genre. Previous genre studies have only referred to the use of literature in one move in discussions, “commenting on results.” However, the results of this study show that intertextual links are used for a variety of rhetorical functions throughout discussions in master’s theses and journal articles. This article concludes with a discussion of implications from this study for the EAP classroom to facilitate the development of advanced second language writers.},

Twelve informants took part in the research, commenting upon their citations in one of their own articles. Informants were not provided with functional checklists, and were free to ascribe as many functions to each citation as they wished. Eleven citation functions are identiﬁed and described, and evidence of inter- and intra-disciplinary similarities and differences is provided. While the computer scientists used citations to direct their audience to further reading more often, the sociologists’ texts featured more cases of critical citations. The type of paper informants were writing (e.g. theoretical/empirical), the anticipated audience, and the publication outlet resulted in intra-disciplinary differences. Over half of the citations in both ﬁelds were said to have more than one function. The insights and implications of the study are discussed.},

Studies have examined the source text use of novices; however, citations in disciplinary assignments by post-novice undergraduate writers have seldom been investigated. Six L2 writers in Year 3 of undergraduate studies in Arts and Social Sciences participated in a study that compared their citations with source texts, the citing practices of other inexperienced writers, and work by published scholars. Citation analysis showed that while nearly three-quarters of students’ citations were of acceptable quality, less eﬀective practices such as inaccurate and narrowly focused citations, patchwriting, and copying still featured, and single source paraphrases were employed for a relatively narrow range of purposes. The supporting roles played by citations in disciplinary assignments, which included showing links between theories and speciﬁc data sets or texts, and supporting students’ arguments became evident. Interviews revealed students’ concerns and a somewhat negative attitude to source text use requirements. It is suggested that EAP writing instruction for postnovices include a focus on rhetorical and disciplinary purposes of source text use.},

The following rhetorical functions of citations are identiﬁed: attribution, exempliﬁcation, further reference, statement of use, application, evaluation, establishing links between sources, and comparison of one’s own work with that of other authors. It is shown that both sets of theses use citations predominantly for attribution, suggesting that one of the functions of citation in student writing is knowledge display. The use of citation for non-attribution functions is found to be considerably lower in the low-rated theses than in the high-rated theses, both in the whole theses and in individual chapters. The ﬁndings show that there is a relationship between citation use and thesis grade, thus pointing to the importance of effective citation strategies for students’ academic success. In conclusion, the paper argues that source use and citation skills should receive more attention in EAP instruction and suggests activities focusing on this area of academic writing.},

Data consist of a corpus of 100 sourcebased research papers written by L2 students in a FYW course. Taking a multi-perspective analytical approach, we examine L2 undergraduate students' citation practices in terms of surface forms, rhetorical functions, and writer stance. Results indicate that L2 students use a restricted range of reporting structures, and they primarily use sources for attribution function to display their knowledge of the topics. Furthermore, as opposed to taking a strong positive or negative position, the ﬁndings show that L2 student writers mainly adopt a non-committal stance by merely acknowledging or distancing themselves from cited materials, suggesting that L2 students are inclined to show deference to the perceived authority of published sources. We conclude with pedagogical options for enhancing L2 university students' citation practices.},

Most of the researches have focused on analyzing the reporting verbs in doctoral theses, students’ assignments, research articles, and journals; however few have focused on Master’s theses. Thus, the purpose of this research is to investigate (1) which reporting verbs are mostly used by Masters students in their theses, (2) the frequency of the reporting verbs used, and (3) the impact(s) of the reporting verbs employed in the theses. Hyland’s (2000) framework is used as a guideline in this document analysis. Six theses completed in 2012 were selected randomly, and they were written by local, Malaysian students who did their Masters in the ELS programme of UKM. A checklist was used as the instrument to identify the groups and the functions of the reporting verbs. The findings showed that Masters students were more familiar with the reporting verbs from the research acts category, as compared to cognition acts and discourse acts. The findings also revealed that the verbs found from the research acts category are the most widely used, while states from the discourse acts category are the most frequently repeated reporting verbs found in Masters theses. The suggestion to consider is to equip the Masters students with the knowledge of using reporting verbs in a Research Methodology course, instead of the structure and the content of the research itself. Our findings are then used to indicate the areas that we need to focus on in academic writing courses.},

Reporting verbs is one of the most important aspects of citation in academic writing which non-native students often fail using them appropriately. Accordingly, this study investigated the frequency of the most used reporting verbs and their function in the Introduction and Literature Review sections of research articles (RAs) written by native and non-native writers. In so doing, a corpus of 60 articles in the field of SLA, 30 by native English authors published in International Journals and 30 by Persian authors published in National Journals, were selected and analysed. The results indicated that there are some differences in the use of reporting verbs between the two corpora. The attained results can be used to design tasks and materials for teaching writing focusing on not only grammar but also rhetorical structures as well as other genres of writing.},

The qualitative data analysis yielded ﬁve citation functions (to claim knowledge, to seek support, to claim importance, to establish a territory, and to claim competence), which are akin to the rhetorical moves identiﬁed in previous research on scholars' grant writing. These ﬁve citation functions are predominantly accompanied with three strategies (to emulate other writers, to follow professors' suggestions, and to mask unfamiliarity with the topic), which are indices of a student identity underlying the above ﬁve rhetorical acts. We discuss how the doctoral students in the study deployed these rhetorical functions and strategies as gambits to project a scholarly identity in their grant proposal writing, and conclude with implications for teaching and further research.},

This article reports on a study designed to investigate cross-disciplinary and cross-linguistic variations of multiple citation features from the unifying perspective of Bakhtinian dialogism. The dataset consisted of 84 research articles sampled from 12 leading Chinese- and English-medium journals of applied linguistics and general medicine. All the citations in the corpus were identiﬁed and examined in an integrative analytic framework that characterized multiple aspects of citations in terms of dialogic contraction (i.e., closing down the space for alternative views) or dialogic expansion (i.e., opening up the space for alternative voices). Quantitative and textual analyses revealed marked cross-disciplinary and cross-linguistic differences in the level and type of citation-based dialogic engagement. These differences are interpreted in reference to the nature of cited information, epistemologies underlying cultural and disciplinary practices, ethnolinguistic norms of communication, and culturally valued interpersonal relationships.

Different types and functions of citations found in the established scholars’ papers were compared to those of the novice academic writers within the same research ﬁeld.

Based on the classiﬁcation, a functional-semantic citation typology was developed. Counts of the citations in each category represented in the typology were then subjected to a series of statistical analyses to examine their distribution across the two journals as well as the two target sections. The results reveal that while all the citation categories in the typology were present in both journals, they appeared only sparingly in the IM articles, and cross-sectional differences in their distribution were statistically signiﬁcant in the MIS Quarterly corpus only.

	abstract = {The importance of establishing a connection with readers in academic writing is now widely acknowledged. The growing literature on this topic, however, has largely concentrated on published ‘expert’ texts and on the ways that writers use language to project their stance or identity. In contrast, this paper will focus on strategies which writers use to represent their readers rather than themselves, using language to structure and negotiate relationships with their addressees. Using a framework of ‘engagement’ (Hyland, K. (2001). Bringing in the reader: Addressee features in academic writing. Written Communication, 18(4), 549–574; Hyland, K. (2005a). Stance and engagement: A model of interaction in academic discourse. Discourse Studies, 7(2), 173–191), the paper examines a corpus of 64 project reports (650,000 words) written by ﬁnal year Hong Kong undergraduates together with transcripts of interviews with students. The work sets out to explore how writers seek to explicitly establish the presence of their readers in this genre and to compare these with the practices of professional academics in research papers, going on to show how the different purposes of these writers inﬂuence the construction of the reader in the text. The analysis contributes to our understanding of audience engagement and the dialogic nature of persuasion in academic argument, but also suggests how students understand their readers and express these understandings in writing.},

Citation as an important discursive feature contributing to authorial voice has been underexplored, despite fruitful research on citation practices. It also remains largely unknown whether variations in citation-based voice construction exist in doctoral theses completed across training contexts. This study explores and compares authorial voice constructed in citation in the literature review chapters of 20 doctoral theses written by home-grown and overseas-trained Chinese writers (HGWT and OTWT), complemented by interviews with four of the 20 writers. It was found that compared to the HGWT, the OTWT displayed signiﬁcantly greater use of nonintegral citations, “author as agent” integral forms, and summary that contribute to authorial voice. Descriptive statistics for the two subcorpora also suggested that authorial voice was more often communicated via lexical devices loaded with evaluation by the ten home-grown writers whereas the ten overseas-trained writers preferred syntactic and discoursal devices. While the present results are more suggestive than deterministic, this study highlights the importance of promoting novice writers' awareness of the obscure and often unnoticed role of citation in constructing authorial voice.},

Research has highlighted the fact that language which constructs gender as binary harms trans people, and some trans studies researchers have developed guidelines for honouring trans people’s names and pronouns. The language of academic writing is an area of discussion where questions of trans rights and trans experiences have not yet been addressed. This paper draws on two data sources to explore the citation experiences and practices of trans scholars and activists: a web-based archive of writers’ perspectives built between 2015 and 2016; and a corpus-based study of 14 research articles published in TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly. Our analysis highlights the sensitivity that is required of colleagues who work with transgender authors’ writing, furthering our understanding of citation as a collaborative and potentially intimate and caring practice. Practices of referring to work by trans scholars pose ethical questions about the social relations expressed in citation in general, enabling applied language scholars to develop a new and different awareness of the sociality of citation.},

Previous research, however, has focused on several aspects of citation practices in a largely discrete fashion and addressed disciplinary and ethnolinguistic inﬂuences on citation in isolation from each other. This article reports on a study designed to investigate cross-disciplinary and cross-linguistic variations of multiple citation features from the unifying perspective of Bakhtinian dialogism. The dataset consisted of 84 research articles sampled from 12 leading Chinese- and English-medium journals of applied linguistics and general medicine. All the citations in the corpus were identiﬁed and examined in an integrative analytic framework that characterized multiple aspects of citations in terms of dialogic contraction (i.e., closing down the space for alternative views) or dialogic expansion (i.e., opening up the space for alternative voices). Quantitative and textual analyses revealed marked cross-disciplinary and cross-linguistic differences in the level and type of citation-based dialogic engagement. These differences are interpreted in reference to the nature of cited information, epistemologies underlying cultural and disciplinary practices, ethnolinguistic norms of communication, and culturally valued interpersonal relationships. Pedagogical implications derived from these ﬁndings are discussed.},

This paper reports the results of a case study on citation practices in 14 research papers written by non-native expert and novice writers who belong to the same discipline and work in a major research university in Malaysia. Different types and functions of citations found in the established scholars’ papers were compared to those of the novice academic writers within the same research ﬁeld. The ﬁndings indicated that types and functions of citations employed were different: novice writers mainly used citation to attribute while the experts used citations strategically to provide support and justify their claims. Novices mainly used citations in isolation whereas expert writers succinctly synthesized various sources and made greater use of non-integral citations. The results of the study could provide better understanding of the rhetorical functions of citations in academic writing and offer pedagogical opportunities for teaching academic writing to novice research writers.},

The discourse-based interview approach (Odell, Goswami, \& Harrington, 1983) was used to elicit Soﬁe’s perceived citation functions, followed by quantifying the qualitative codings to allow for comparison. The ﬁndings show that some of the citation functions Soﬁe described were the same in both assignments, while others were task speciﬁc. Soﬁe used citations in both assignments to deﬁne terms and support her arguments. However, it was only in her assignment for the open task that she used citations to show the relevance of her chosen topic. Conversely, she frequently used citations to apply citees’ concepts to her own analysis in the directed task, but not in the open task. We conclude by discussing the implications of our ﬁndings for L2 writing instruction.},

To perform the analysis, the Results and the Discussion sections of the articles were ﬁrst parsed into moves, and citations in each of the moves were classiﬁed according to their rhetorical functions and the types of knowledge cited (semantic content). Based on the classiﬁcation, a functional-semantic citation typology was developed. Counts of the citations in each category represented in the typology were then subjected to a series of statistical analyses to examine their distribution across the two journals as well as the two target sections. The results reveal that while all the citation categories in the typology were present in both journals, they appeared only sparingly in the IM articles, and cross-sectional differences in their distribution were statistically signiﬁcant in the MIS Quarterly corpus only. Pedagogical implications will be presented.},

Therefore, this two-year UK-based study aims to help ﬁll this gap by examining the source use of three Chinese postgraduate students of business, technology and public relations. Data was gathered over four iterations through a Pre-Master’s EAP programme and subsequent Master’s degree, in order to investigate the development of source use on both EAP and Master’s programmes. Four features of source use in the assignments –citation, paraphrasing, reporting verbs and attribution – were analysed over the period. Analysis of the results shows that participants started at different points, progressed differently, and did not all reach a competent level. Participants also developed some individual strategies in their source use, such as relying on a small range of features, overcitation and copying sections of attributed text, especially internet sources. The ﬁndings offer an insight into student practices and suggest the need for greater and more continuous pedagogical support to enable students to achieve competence in source use.},

The Chinese paraphrases were found to contain signiﬁcantly more textual borrowing from the matching source text than the English paraphrases. The former were not all acknowledged but the latter were. There were also a total of 80 mentions of content recontextualization (55 Chinese and 25 English).

To that end, the current study examined how students use sources in their own writing at an English-medium university in Canada and what challenges they face in doing so. Notes and essays written by English for Academic Purposes (EAP) students (N ¼ 73) were analyzed in terms of how they used source text information. A subset of the students and ﬁve experienced instructors were interviewed to gain insight into students’ challenges with the source-based writing tasks required in the EAP program.

	abstract = {In the scholarly environment, research ﬁndings are disseminated as journal papers which support/dispute extant knowledge or add further to what is already known. The entire manuscript needs to be cited (in-text) and referenced (at the end of article), in order for readers to ascertain the validity of the research claim/s. This must be done in proper and accepted fashion as plagiarism is a serious misdeed and inappropriate referencing mars a paper. Recent advancements in technology have led to the development of bibliographic management software tools. These tools are available as both commercial and open source software, and constitute a database wherein researchers search, store and cite references. Furthermore, authors can not only create personalized databases but also cite stored articles when compiling a manuscript or report or indeed any other form of document. This software obviates human manual inputting errors and inaccurate referencing, while conveniently enabling citation and referencing in any referencing style required, for example, after rejection, when an author must almost perforce resubmit a prepared but rejected paper to a diﬀerent journal after suitable amendments.},
