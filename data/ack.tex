  I would like to sincerely give my deep gratitude to Professor YAN Yi for her generous, professional, timely, patient, and meticulous help and instructions on my research and my thesis writing. Never before in my years at Tsinghua University had anyone offered word-by-word reviews or comprehensive advice covering both general directions and minute details like Professor YAN did. Thank you, professor.

  In my course of writing the thesis, my friend LIU Qipeng kindly accepted to take the tedious job to be my proofreader, and identified various mistakes that I might otherwise have ignored.

  The courses offered by the English Language and Literature second-degree program laid my foundation for the completion of the thesis. To my fellow classmates of the class of 2019 from the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures and the second-degree program: it was really a fabulous and fantastic experience working with all of you. Thank you all for the countless but unique and unforgettable memories you have offered me.
